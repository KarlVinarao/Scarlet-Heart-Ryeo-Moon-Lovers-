            <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
            <p>During a total solar eclipse, a 25-year-old 21st-century woman, <span class="character">Go Ha-jin</span>,
            is transported back in time, to the Goryeo Dynasty. She wakes up in the year of 941, in the body of <span class="character">Hae Soo</span>,
            among the many princes of the ruling Wang family, during the reign of King Taejo. She initially falls in love with the gentle and warm-hearted 
            <span class="character">8th Prince Wang Wook</span>, but later develops a relationship with <span class="character">Wang So</span>, 
            the fearsome 4th Prince, who hides his face behind a mask and is given the derogatory label of "wolf-dog". As the story develops, 
            <span class="character">Hae Soo</span> finds herself unwittingly caught up in the palace politics and the 
            rivalry among the princes, as they fight for the throne.</p>
